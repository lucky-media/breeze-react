## Introduction

Breeze provides a minimal and simple starting point for building a Laravel application with authentication. Styled with Tailwind, Breeze publishes authentication controllers and views to your application that can be easily customized based on your own application's needs.

This package installs only the Inertia version with React as a frontend library. 


Getting started couldn't be easier:

```bash
laravel new my-app

cd my-app

composer require lucky-media/breeze-react --dev

php artisan breeze:install
```

After the breeze scaffolding has finished, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```
